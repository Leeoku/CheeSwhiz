# CheeSwhiz
CheeSwhiz is an api that allows users to fulfill their wildest cheese dreams. Please visit: http://cheeswhiz.herokuapp.com/api-docs/ for full documentation.

CheeSwhiz accomplished it's goals it set out to complete in from the proposal. Everyone can view all cheeses in the database; add a cheese to the database; search for cheeses by name, animal milk, firmness; find a substitute cheese; randomly generate a cheese; and find a local cheese store. Everyone can log in or create a basic account with CheeSwhiz. This allows users to save favorite cheeses, add notes to those cheeses, and delete favorites.  Lastly there are super-users (@danielmarcgardner and @reidPD) who can update cheeses in the database as well as delete them.

While we accomplished all of our goals there are some stretches we would like to implement in the future. We would like to make a more robust database with more cheeses as well as add in various other characteristics like aromas, country of origin, texture. We would also like to add in other animals to the table. Our goal of using nightmare.js to scrape the web for cheeses was timeboxed and expired however we would like to continue to explore that option. Lastly we believe that we should restrict who can add cheeses to the database and make sure that they are at least logged in to be able to add cheeses to the database for tracking purposes.
